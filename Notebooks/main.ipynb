    "# TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn in the near future. By leveraging historical data, the model aims to help the telecommunications company proactively retain at-risk customers through targeted interventions and personalized offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be leveraging the widely used CRISP-DM Framework for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework is a widely used methodology for data mining and data analysis projects. It provides a structured approach for planning and executing data projects. The process is cyclic and iterative, consisting of six phases:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "- Hypothesis 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption : Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale behind assumption : Long-term customers may have higher satisfaction and loyalty due to their prolonged association with the company and potential benefits received over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption : Customers who use multiple services (e.g., Internet, phone, TV) are less likely to churn compared to those who use fewer services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale behind assumption : Customers with bundled services may find it more convenient and cost-effective to stay with the provider, making them less likely to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption : Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale behind assumption : Higher monthly charges might indicate dissatisfaction with the value for money, leading customers to seek cheaper alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the main reasons behind customer churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Understanding the primary factors contributing to churn can help in addressing the root causes and developing effective retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, marital status) are more likely to churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Identifying specific demographic groups that are more prone to churn can help tailor marketing and retention efforts to those segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How does the length of the customer's tenure impact their likelihood to churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Analyzing the relationship between tenure and churn can reveal whether long-term customers are more loyal and what measures can be taken to extend customer tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What role do service issues (e.g., technical support, service outages) play in customer churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Assessing the impact of service quality on churn can guide improvements in customer support and service reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do different payment methods (e.g., automatic payments vs. manual payments) affect churn rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Understanding the influence of payment methods on churn can help in promoting more stable payment options that reduce churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the impact of contract types (e.g., month-to-month vs. annual contracts) on customer retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Analyzing how contract terms affect churn can inform decisions on offering more flexible or beneficial contract options to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which services or combinations of services (e.g., Internet, phone, TV) have the highest and lowest churn rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Identifying which services are most and least likely to retain customers can help in designing better service packages and cross-selling strategies."
